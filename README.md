# No Hands-Free Bluetooth mode for Revenge
Get rid of that shitty ass quality in Discord calls

It's in the form of a /eval script (until I get Revenge to fucking fetch the JS and turn that god damn plugin on once I create it)...
so basically you need to run that script each time you launch the app ✌️ (if the app was entirely closed, if it was still running, it's fine)
